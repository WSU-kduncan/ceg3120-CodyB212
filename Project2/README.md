Step 1: Creating VPC

The created VPC is named BRADLEY-VPC. This VPC will create a virtual private network with 10.0.0.0/24 in CIDR block formatting,
which implements a range of IP addresses that will be used and associated with in the private network.

Step 2: Creating Subnet

I created a subnet named BRADLEY-Subnet. I had to connect this subnet to my BRADLEY-VPC. The subnet with a private /24 private IP
range. This will allow a broad spectrum of 10.0.0.0/24 private IP addresses to be used inside of the VPC.
